    that could reasonably be used (by itself or in combination with other data reasonably available) to identify a
    natural person.
  </p>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    This Privacy Statement describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Data and how you
    can access and update this information. This statement also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our

  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    When you visit our websites, register for the Service, or request more information about our services, we may
    request that you provide Personal Data about yourself, and we also collect navigational information. In some cases,
    if you do not provide sufficient Personal Data, we may not be able to provide all our available products and
    services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Personal Data</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We collect Personal Data such as name, title, phone number, email address, mailing address, and IP address.
    Additionally, when you sign up for our paid service, we collect your billing information, including your credit card
    number, expiration date, and billing address.

  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Navigational Information</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We may also automatically collect navigational information such as your browser including your browser type,
    referrer page, domain name, access time, entry page, exit page, operating system type, and search engine keywords
    used.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    As is true of most websites, we may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms (web beacons, device identifiers and
    similar technologies) to recognize you across websites and provide certain functionality. We use cookies tied to
    Personal Data for essential operations, such as maintaining the security of authenticated user sessions. While you
    can disable cookies used at the browser level, it is not recommended because certain features and/or controls may
    not function as designed or as required to effectively and securely use our services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">How we use your Information</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We use the information we collect through our websites and services to measure our business success, to identify
    effective ways to communicate with or educate our customers and prospects, to meet requests for certain product
    features and services, and to communicate about product updates and service incidents.
  </p>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We often act as an agent (the data processor) for each of our customers, in that we process Personal Data only on
    the instructions from our customers (the data controller). As per our customer agreements, we do not access or make
    use of any data collected on the customer’s behalf except as necessary to provide our services to that customer. We
    do not aggregate, transfer, or otherwise disclose it to anyone but the customer, or pursuant to the customer’s
    instructions. We do, however, reserve a right to disclose data we collect if required by law or valid order of a
    court or other governmental authority.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Information we Share</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We will not rent, sell, or share Personal Data about you with third parties except to provide services that you have
    requested.
  </p>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We do need to disclose Personal Data to third-party agents that work on our behalf to provide our services, but only
    to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. For example, we use third party agents for
    infrastructure hosting services and payment processing. All such third parties function as our agents performing
    services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide an equivalent level
    of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Statement and any applicable data processing agreement in
    place.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">How to Access and Update your Information</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    You have the ability to access, change and delete the Personal Data you submitted when you registered for the
    Service
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">International Data Transfers</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    Because our services are globally dispersed, we may process information in many countries, and therefore your
    Personal Data may be transferred to servers located in different geographical areas. We process information as both
    a data controller and a data processor, and we take the necessary steps in these distinct capacities to ensure the
    protection for international transfers in compliance with applicable data protections laws and regulations.
  </p>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    On request, and for an extra charge, we can host all data on computers based geographically inside the European
    Union.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Data Security and Integrity</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We use robust security measures to protect the Personal Data
    submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. All information transferred within our systems is
    automatically served through a secure connection (HTTPS). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
    method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we have implemented and will maintain appropriate security
    measures to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We use commercially acceptable
    means to maintain the integrity of your Personal Data and have implemented physical, technical, and administrative
    safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and destruction.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Data Retention</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We retain Personal Data that you provide to us where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for
    example, as long as is required in order to contact you about our services, or as needed to comply with our legal
    obligations.
  </p>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We regularly review collected data and set data retention policies to delete data in accordance with contractual
    agreements, legal obligations and applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Do Not Track Response</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the websites you visit
    indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. However, some browsers with the “do not track”
    option selected may still accept cookies. Because there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to
    “do not track” signal, we do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will
    modify this statement accordingly.
  </p>
  <h3 class="privacy__heading-3">Material Changes</h3>
  <p class="privacy__paragraph">
    We reserve the right to make changes to this statement at any time to reflect changes to our data practices, so
    please review it frequently. Should we make material changes to the manner in which your Personal Data is processed,
    we will notify customers via email (sent to the email address specified in the user profile) and also post a notice
    on our website.
